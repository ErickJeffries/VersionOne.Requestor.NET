# Explore Improved JSON Support in the VersionOne Data API

The VersionOne dev team is hard at work trying to make it easier for you to program against 
our [Core API](http://community.versionone.com/sdk/documentation/coreapi.aspx). The goal of this article is 
to help you get started creating your own custom apps that interact with the VersionOne Data API, using standard 
open source HTML and JavaScript tools.

Based on customer feedback, the first step we're taking is to add stronger support for simplified [JSON-based](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) 
HTTP requests and respones. We're also adding support for [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), 
an even cleaner and simpler data format than JSON (JSON is actually a subset of YAML). 

But, since JSON is the native format for JavaScript data, we'll focus on how it will make it easier to program
against the API than the default XML data format.

**In this how-to, you will:**

* Take a tour of a sample app built using the new JSON support, the VersionOne Requestor App
* Understand how the Requestor app leverages the main features of the VersionOne Data API
* Explore how the new, improved JSON support for the API powers the Requestor App
* Create a simpler version of the Requestor App using JSFiddle, and:
* Examine the HTTP requests and responses that our newly created app sends and receives to and from 
the VersionOne Data API

**What you'll need:**

Just Google Chrome. Most of this will work in other browsers, but you'll have to use their own developer tools.

## Test drive the VersionOne Requestor App

The VersionOne Requestor App is a simple, one page web app that serves one purpose: it lets users save and edit 
feature requests for a project within a VersionOne instance.

TODO: finish this section based on M, D feedback from 1/25

## Introduction to the VersionOne Data API's JSON Support

At the heart of the sample app we'll examine is [JSON](http://www.json.org/). 
VersionOne does not yet natively support the JSON format that we use in this app. 
But, the DLLs from the [VersionOne.SDK.Experimental repo](http://www.github.com/versionone/VersionOne.SDK.Experimental) 
add that support in an unobtrusive way in conjunction with a simple `Web.config` change. 
We'll also incorporate this support directly into the Core product 
for "out of the box" support in future releases. However, if you're interested in using this support on your 
own instance right now, then please contact us.

Before we look at any code, we'll click through some buttons in a sample V1 Requestor app and use 
Chrome's Developer Tools to examine the HTTP requests and responses.

## 1. Search for projects by name

* First, open Chrome, then open the Developer Tools by hitting `F12`, and select the Network tab
* Open [`http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/v1requestor/index.html`](http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/v1requestor/index.html)
* Type `system` into the text box
* Hit `Enter`

Now, in the Chrome Developer Tools' Network tab, we can inspect the HTTP request and HTTP response:

### HTTP Request generated

The URL created should look something like this:

#### URL

```
http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope?acceptFormat=haljson&sel=Name&page=100%2C0&find='system'&findin=Name
```

Let's examine the URL in more detail. In order for the VersionOne Data API comprise this HTTP request:

* `sel=Name` *return only the `Name` attribute from the remote resource*
* `page=100,0` *return 100 items max, starting at page 0*
* `find='system'` *search for the word `system`*
* `findin=Name` *search for `find` parameter's value within the `Name` attribute only*

These parameters, taken together, tell the API what to do in order

#### Headers

A look at the full headers:

```text
GET /platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope?acceptFormat=haljson&sel=Name&page=100%2C0&find='system'&findin=Name HTTP/1.1
Host: eval.versionone.net
Connection: keep-alive
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/23.0.1271.97 Safari/537.11
Accept: */*
Referer: http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/v1requestor/index.html
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3
```

### HTTP Response received

The response Content-Type header is `haljson`. [HAL is a proposed standard](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) 
for hypermedia documents. The format of the JSON returned in this sample aims to comply with HAL. 
Where you see `acceptFormat=haljson`, that's how the server knows we want the data returned in that format.

#### Headers

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 186
Content-Type: haljson; charset=utf-8
Expires: -1
Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Date: Mon, 14 Jan 2013 22:34:20 GMT
```

#### Body

```json
[
  {
    "Name": "System (All Projects)",
    "_links": {
      "self": {
        "href": "/VersionOne.Web/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope/0",
        "id": "Scope:0"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## 2. Select a project and fetch its Requests assets

* Still with the Chrome Developer Tools and Network tab open, click the 'System (All Projeccts)` result
* Click the `List` button to fetch the Request list

### HTTP Request URL generated

```text
http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request?acceptFormat=haljson&where=Scope%3D'Scope%3A0'&sel=Name%2CRequestedBy&page=75%2C0&sort=-ChangeDate
```

Again, various VersionOne Data API parameters comprise this URL:

* `where=Scope='Scope:0'` *return a Scope asset with the given id*
* `sel=Name,RequestedBy` *return the Name and RequestedBy attributes of this Scope asset*
* `page=75,0` *return 75 items max, starting at page 0*
* `sort=-ChangeDate` *sort the results in desending order by the ChangeDate attribute*

### HTTP Response received

The HTTP response contains an array of JSON objects that contain only the Name and RequestedBy attributes. This then gets used to populate the listview.

```json
[
  {
    "Name": "Date fields should look better",
    "RequestedBy": "Blaine Stussy",
    "_links": {
      "self": {
        "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1152",
        "id": "Request:1152"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "Name": "As an API Adopter, I can deploy the Requestor Tool easily",
    "RequestedBy": "Ian Buchanan",
    "_links": {
      "self": {
        "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1151",
        "id": "Request:1151"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "Name": "Add the Custom_Team custom field to the Request form",
    "RequestedBy": "Blaine Stussy",
    "_links": {
      "self": {
        "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1150",
        "id": "Request:1150"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## 3. Select a Request to edit

* Now click the `Add the Custom_Team custom field to the Request form` request

### HTTP Request URL generated

```text
http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1150?acceptFormat=haljson&sel=RequestedBy%2CName%2CDescription%2CPriority
```

The VersionOne API parameters breakdown:

* `/Data/Request/1150` *the specific URL that uniquely identifies this Scope asset*
* `sel=RequestedBy,Name,Description,Priority` *return just these four attributes*

### HTTP Response received

This time, we have several more fields, including the `Priority`, which is itself a `Relation`. By default, the VersionOne API projects the `Priority.Name` value into the result as well.

```json
{
  "RequestedBy": "Blaine Stussy",
  "Name": "Add the Custom_Team custom field to the Request form",
  "Description": "Please add the Custom_Team field to the Request form for the CapEx project, and only the CapEx project",
  "Priority.Name": "High",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1150",
      "id": "Request:1150"
    },
    "Priority": [
      {
        "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/RequestPriority/169",
        "idref": "RequestPriority:169"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 4. Modify the Request and save

* Change the `Description` field to specify some more detail. I changed it to:

```text
Please add the Custom_Team field, between the Description and Priority fields, to the Request form for the CapEx project, and only for the CapEx project
```

* Click the `Save` button

### HTTP Request generated

#### URL
```text
http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1150?acceptFormat=haljson
```

This time, the URL is nothing but the address of the asset, plus the `acceptFormat` parameter to the backend service.

#### POST body

```json
{
    "RequestedBy": "Blaine Stussy",
    "Name": "Add the Custom_Team custom field to the Request form",
    "Description": "Please add the Custom_Team field, between the Description and Priority fields, to the Request form for the CapEx project, and only for the CapEx project",
    "_links": {
        "Scope": {
            "idref": "Scope:0"
        },
        "Priority": {
            "idref": "RequestPriority:169"
        }
    }
}
```
**Note**: Because `Priority` is a Relation, there's no need to send the `Priority.Name`. Instead, it just sends a `_link` relation with the idref.

**Question:** for [RESTafarians](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven) out there, what do you think about this: would be more RESTful to 
require sending the full address of the `href` param, that is `/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/RequestPriority/169`, 
instead of the shorter, non-address value from `idref`? See Roy Fielding's blog post 
[REST APIs must be hypertext-driven](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven) 
for more background.

### HTTP Response received

This time, we have several more fields, including the `Priority`, which is itself a `Relation`. 
By default, the VersionOne API projects the `Priority.Name` value into the result as well.

```json
{
  "RequestedBy": "Blaine Stussy",
  "Name": "Add the Custom_Team custom field to the Request form",
  "Description": "Please add the Custom_Team field, between the Description and Priority fields, to the Request form for the CapEx project, and only for the CapEx project",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1150/1321",
      "id": "Request:1150:1321"
    },
    "Scope": [
      {
        "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope/0",
        "idref": "Scope:0"
      }
    ],
    "Priority": [
      {
        "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/RequestPriority/169",
        "idref": "RequestPriority:169"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Important in this HTTP response:

* It contains the same fields that we sent it, and only those fields
* The `_links.self.href` and `_links.self.id` properties contain the asset's `Moment`, which is a specific, very precise address of the asset. Since all asset changes are retained, this provides the exact location for this *version* of the asset. Note that if we now request the asset without the moment, the asset will still have the same state. However, someone else could change it before we do that. 
In that case, we can always request this specific moment of the asset's state by using the moment-containing URL or id.
* **NOTE**: I am not sure why it returned the Scope as a relation.

# Conclusion

I hope you found this useful as a gentle introduction to the VersionOne Data API using JSON! But, might
you be itching to start coding against the API yourself, using familiar open source JS libs like 
jQuery and Backbone.js? If so, then stay tuned for the next how-to example, which will show exactly that!
