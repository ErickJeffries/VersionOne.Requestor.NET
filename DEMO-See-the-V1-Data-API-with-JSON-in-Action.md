# Sample App Demo: VersionOne Requestor

Take a tour of a sample app built using the VersionOne REST Data API.

## A Hack of the Clones
If you've been writing web apps with any of the increasingly, often maddeningly, popular JavaScript MV* 
frameworks or libraries, then you've come across the classic, obligatory "Todos" app clones. Here's a list of 
just a handful of them:

* [Todos](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/examples/todos/index.html) -- Backbone.js
* [Todos](http://todos.derbyjs.com/derby) -- Derby.js
* [Todos](http://meteor.com/examples/todos) -- MeteorJS
* [Todos](https://github.com/emberjs/todos) -- EmberJS
* [Todos](sammystodos.brandonaaron.net/) -- Sammy.js (hey, looks like an actual todo list!)

And, the last shall be first:

* [Tasks](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/) -- GMail Tasks FTW

Ok, just kidding about that last one. If you want to go mad, then visit this site:

* [TodoMVC](http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/) -- Todos written in thousands of JavaScript MV* frameworks

The idea behind these apps is for you to keep track of personal todos or tasks and check them off as you complete 
them. Simple enough. Nice for things like "pay bills" or "buy movie tickets".

## Not in My Backlog!

But, as a software developer you know such an app will not suffice for your customers and your workflow. You get 
way too many change requests, feature requests, nice to haves, must haves, etc. Isn't that why you found VersionOne 
in the first place, isn't it? You want to keep track of what you have to work on and how to get it **DONE**!

When you start using VersionOne to manage agile projects, you realize you cannot always jump straight into planning 
stories and iterations! Your organization, or your customers, have lots of things they want to do or see you do. 
Using the Requests feature of a Project is a good way to store these items before you are able to more formally 
pull them into an iteration or turn them into Epics or Stories. 

***Explaining the powerful and full-blown capabilities of the VersionOne software smells too much 
like marketing and is thus outside the scope of this demonstration, but you can learn more about that on 
the [Agile Product Planning Tool](http://www.versionone.com/Product/Agile-Planning-Tools/) 
page on the main VersionOne web site.***

## Individuals and Interactions, or: How and When Customer Requests *Really Happen*

But, what if you don't want to force your customers or your users to be **registered in VersionOne** simply to get 
those requests into your backlog? Or, what if they believe it's *your job*, not theirs, to utilize the VersionOne 
software tool to facilitate the planning and delivery of products and services?

Now, before you get upset with people for not following your plans for their behavior with the shiny 
tools you bought them, remember that line from the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)?

This one: 

> Through this work we have come to value: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Oh, and this one:

> Through the work we have come to value: Responding to change over following a plan

As I said in the introduction to this series, it would be ***arrogant beyond belief*** to think that we, 
a tool vendor, could solve all your needs, "out of the box", with a tool we create -- given that you 
embrace those core agile values!

## What if These Real World Scenarios Ring True?

* You have a customer-facing or user-facing web site with a form for change requests or enhancements?
* You have lots of new people bringing up ideas in meetings and you cannot waste time creating new accounts for 
all these people just to get their ideas into VersionOne?
* You walk the halls with your iPad or Android tablet, and users throw ideas off to you, and you want to capture 
those ideas quickly?
* Or, similarly, you conduct usability and testing labs for your own products with your users, and you want to 
use your tablet to jot down change requests and feedback as painlessly as possible?
* Or, even more modern, a user says: *"I spend a lot of time thinking on the train or in the carpool, where I have 
no network access, can you make a tool that lets me save requests on my tablet, then upload when I'm online?"*

These scenarios are most easily served by custom apps that integrate with VersionOne using the VersionOne APIs. And 
we have developed the VersionOne Requestor App as an example that can help you in the these kinds of scenarios. It 
is a simple app, and we will now walk through it functionally, and then we'll see how it works under the covers. 
Looking under the covers will help you understand how you can customize it or how you can build your own custom 
apps with simple HTML, JavaScript, and the VersionOne APIs!

## VersionOne Requestor Walkthrough: Let Customers Describe Wants and Needs in VersionOne as "Requests"

You can follow along with this if you want by jumping over to [http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/v1requestor/]
(http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/v1requestor). Note that some of the items may look a little different if 
people have been playing around, but the basic workflow should work.

### Known issues
If you search for something that doesn't exist, it is blowing up right now :) Will fix soon! 
Stick with the script for now!

### Home

The home page has a simple search box where you, or your customer, can search for a Project by name. Type `system` 
and hit `Enter` to pull up the example 'System (All Projects)` project.

![Home](https://raw.github.com/versionone/VersionOne.Requestor.NET/master/part02/requestor-01-home-a.png)

### Search for a project

After typing `system` and hitting enter, it will return the project into the list:

![Search](https://raw.github.com/versionone/VersionOne.Requestor.NET/master/part02/requestor-02-search.png)

### Select project to pull up a new Request form

Click the item, and it will open up a new Request entry form:

![Select Project / New Request](https://raw.github.com/versionone/VersionOne.Requestor.NET/master/part02/requestor-03-new.png)

### Enter new Request details

Fill in some details, and select a `High` priority (if your request is awesome!)

![Save New Request](https://raw.github.com/versionone/VersionOne.Requestor.NET/master/part02/requestor-04-enter.png)

### Save new Request

Once, you've typed in the Request details, click the `Save` button on the bottom right. It should display a green 
success message at the top. You can keep modifying the details if you'd like to add in more info, 
or click `New` from the top to start a brand new Request.

![Home](https://raw.github.com/versionone/VersionOne.Requestor.NET/master/part02/requestor-05-save.png)

### Select Request from list

Click the `List` button from the top left. This takes you back tot he list of Requests for the Project. Your new item 
should be there at the top of the list now. You can click on that to edit it, or just keep following along with the 
screen shots.

![Select Request](https://raw.github.com/versionone/VersionOne.Requestor.NET/master/part02/requestor-06-list.png)

### Modify and save Request

After picking a Request, and modifying its details, click the `Save` button. It should display a green success message.

***Note:*** if you empty out the `Request Title`, a required field, it will highlight the field and show a big bad 
red error message. Try it.

![Save Request](https://raw.github.com/versionone/VersionOne.Requestor.NET/master/part02/requestor-07-update.png)

## View Requests List in VersionOne

If you login to the test VersionOne instance, at [http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest]
(http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest) with username / password of `admin / admin`, then you can click the 
`Requests` tab and see the list, with your entry in it:

# TODO: Give conclusion and preview of the technical walkthrough
























This is an introduction to the **Developing Custom Apps with VersionOne APIs 101** tutorial series. It demonstrates how 
to create your own custom apps for VersionOne using standard HTML and open source JavaScript libraries that you 
already know and love. Starting with what you already know, or can easily learn, you'll tie into the
[VersionOne REST APIs] (http://community.versionone.com/sdk/documentation/coreapi.aspx) to build extensions and 
customizations to VersionOne that only you and your team can dream up!

By reading this series and performing the code exercises, you'll learn about new, simplified and 
improved JSON support in the API that augments the older XML format. This [JSON support is still experimental]
(https://github.com/versionone/VersionOne.SDK.Experimental), and we're seeking your input and feedback!


# TODO: NEED TO REVISIT EVERYTHING BELOW

Based on customer feedback, the first step we're taking is to add stronger support for simplified [JSON-based](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) 
HTTP requests and respones. We're also adding support for [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), 
an even cleaner and simpler data format than JSON (JSON is actually a subset of YAML). 

But, since JSON is the native format for JavaScript data, we'll focus on how it will make it easier to program
against the API than the default XML data format.

**In this how-to, you will:**

* Take a tour of a sample app built using the new JSON support, the VersionOne Requestor App
* Understand how the Requestor app leverages the main features of the VersionOne Data API
* Explore how the new, improved JSON support for the API powers the Requestor App
* Create a simpler version of the Requestor App using JSFiddle, and:
* Examine the HTTP requests and responses that our newly created app sends and receives to and from 
the VersionOne Data API

**What you'll need:**

Just Google Chrome. Most of this will work in other browsers, but you'll have to use their own developer tools.

## Test drive the VersionOne Requestor App

The VersionOne Requestor App is a simple, one page web app that serves one purpose: it lets users save and edit 
feature requests for a project within a VersionOne instance.

TODO: finish this section based on M, D feedback from 1/25

## Introduction to the VersionOne Data API's JSON Support

At the heart of the sample app we'll examine is [JSON](http://www.json.org/). 
VersionOne does not yet natively support the JSON format that we use in this app. 
But, the DLLs from the [VersionOne.SDK.Experimental repo](http://www.github.com/versionone/VersionOne.SDK.Experimental) 
add that support in an unobtrusive way in conjunction with a simple `Web.config` change. 
We'll also incorporate this support directly into the Core product 
for "out of the box" support in future releases. However, if you're interested in using this support on your 
own instance right now, then please contact us.

Before we look at any code, we'll click through some buttons in a sample V1 Requestor app and use 
Chrome's Developer Tools to examine the HTTP requests and responses.

## 1. Search for projects by name

* First, open Chrome, then open the Developer Tools by hitting `F12`, and select the Network tab
* Open [`http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/v1requestor/index.html`](http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/v1requestor/index.html)
* Type `system` into the text box
* Hit `Enter`

Now, in the Chrome Developer Tools' Network tab, we can inspect the HTTP request and HTTP response:

### HTTP Request generated

The URL created should look something like this:

#### URL

```
http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope?acceptFormat=haljson&sel=Name&page=100%2C0&find='system'&findin=Name
```

Let's examine the URL in more detail. In order for the VersionOne Data API comprise this HTTP request:

* `sel=Name` *return only the `Name` attribute from the remote resource*
* `page=100,0` *return 100 items max, starting at page 0*
* `find='system'` *search for the word `system`*
* `findin=Name` *search for `find` parameter's value within the `Name` attribute only*

These parameters, taken together, tell the API what to do in order

#### Headers

A look at the full headers:

```text
GET /platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope?acceptFormat=haljson&sel=Name&page=100%2C0&find='system'&findin=Name HTTP/1.1
Host: eval.versionone.net
Connection: keep-alive
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/23.0.1271.97 Safari/537.11
Accept: */*
Referer: http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/v1requestor/index.html
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3
```

### HTTP Response received

The response Content-Type header is `haljson`. [HAL is a proposed standard](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) 
for hypermedia documents. The format of the JSON returned in this sample aims to comply with HAL. 
Where you see `acceptFormat=haljson`, that's how the server knows we want the data returned in that format.

#### Headers

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 186
Content-Type: haljson; charset=utf-8
Expires: -1
Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Date: Mon, 14 Jan 2013 22:34:20 GMT
```

#### Body

```json
[
  {
    "Name": "System (All Projects)",
    "_links": {
      "self": {
        "href": "/VersionOne.Web/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope/0",
        "id": "Scope:0"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## 2. Select a project and fetch its Requests assets

* Still with the Chrome Developer Tools and Network tab open, click the 'System (All Projeccts)` result
* Click the `List` button to fetch the Request list

### HTTP Request URL generated

```text
http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request?acceptFormat=haljson&where=Scope%3D'Scope%3A0'&sel=Name%2CRequestedBy&page=75%2C0&sort=-ChangeDate
```

Again, various VersionOne Data API parameters comprise this URL:

* `where=Scope='Scope:0'` *return a Scope asset with the given id*
* `sel=Name,RequestedBy` *return the Name and RequestedBy attributes of this Scope asset*
* `page=75,0` *return 75 items max, starting at page 0*
* `sort=-ChangeDate` *sort the results in desending order by the ChangeDate attribute*

### HTTP Response received

The HTTP response contains an array of JSON objects that contain only the Name and RequestedBy attributes. This then gets used to populate the listview.

```json
[
  {
    "Name": "Date fields should look better",
    "RequestedBy": "Blaine Stussy",
    "_links": {
      "self": {
        "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1152",
        "id": "Request:1152"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "Name": "As an API Adopter, I can deploy the Requestor Tool easily",
    "RequestedBy": "Ian Buchanan",
    "_links": {
      "self": {
        "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1151",
        "id": "Request:1151"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "Name": "Add the Custom_Team custom field to the Request form",
    "RequestedBy": "Blaine Stussy",
    "_links": {
      "self": {
        "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1150",
        "id": "Request:1150"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## 3. Select a Request to edit

* Now click the `Add the Custom_Team custom field to the Request form` request

### HTTP Request URL generated

```text
http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1150?acceptFormat=haljson&sel=RequestedBy%2CName%2CDescription%2CPriority
```

The VersionOne API parameters breakdown:

* `/Data/Request/1150` *the specific URL that uniquely identifies this Scope asset*
* `sel=RequestedBy,Name,Description,Priority` *return just these four attributes*

### HTTP Response received

This time, we have several more fields, including the `Priority`, which is itself a `Relation`. By default, the VersionOne API projects the `Priority.Name` value into the result as well.

```json
{
  "RequestedBy": "Blaine Stussy",
  "Name": "Add the Custom_Team custom field to the Request form",
  "Description": "Please add the Custom_Team field to the Request form for the CapEx project, and only the CapEx project",
  "Priority.Name": "High",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1150",
      "id": "Request:1150"
    },
    "Priority": [
      {
        "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/RequestPriority/169",
        "idref": "RequestPriority:169"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 4. Modify the Request and save

* Change the `Description` field to specify some more detail. I changed it to:

```text
Please add the Custom_Team field, between the Description and Priority fields, to the Request form for the CapEx project, and only for the CapEx project
```

* Click the `Save` button

### HTTP Request generated

#### URL
```text
http://eval.versionone.net/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1150?acceptFormat=haljson
```

This time, the URL is nothing but the address of the asset, plus the `acceptFormat` parameter to the backend service.

#### POST body

```json
{
    "RequestedBy": "Blaine Stussy",
    "Name": "Add the Custom_Team custom field to the Request form",
    "Description": "Please add the Custom_Team field, between the Description and Priority fields, to the Request form for the CapEx project, and only for the CapEx project",
    "_links": {
        "Scope": {
            "idref": "Scope:0"
        },
        "Priority": {
            "idref": "RequestPriority:169"
        }
    }
}
```
**Note**: Because `Priority` is a Relation, there's no need to send the `Priority.Name`. Instead, it just sends a `_link` relation with the idref.

**Question:** for [RESTafarians](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven) out there, what do you think about this: would be more RESTful to 
require sending the full address of the `href` param, that is `/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/RequestPriority/169`, 
instead of the shorter, non-address value from `idref`? See Roy Fielding's blog post 
[REST APIs must be hypertext-driven](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven) 
for more background.

### HTTP Response received

This time, we have several more fields, including the `Priority`, which is itself a `Relation`. 
By default, the VersionOne API projects the `Priority.Name` value into the result as well.

```json
{
  "RequestedBy": "Blaine Stussy",
  "Name": "Add the Custom_Team custom field to the Request form",
  "Description": "Please add the Custom_Team field, between the Description and Priority fields, to the Request form for the CapEx project, and only for the CapEx project",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Request/1150/1321",
      "id": "Request:1150:1321"
    },
    "Scope": [
      {
        "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope/0",
        "idref": "Scope:0"
      }
    ],
    "Priority": [
      {
        "href": "/platformtest/rest-1.v1/Data/RequestPriority/169",
        "idref": "RequestPriority:169"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Important in this HTTP response:

* It contains the same fields that we sent it, and only those fields
* The `_links.self.href` and `_links.self.id` properties contain the asset's `Moment`, which is a specific, very precise address of the asset. Since all asset changes are retained, this provides the exact location for this *version* of the asset. Note that if we now request the asset without the moment, the asset will still have the same state. However, someone else could change it before we do that. 
In that case, we can always request this specific moment of the asset's state by using the moment-containing URL or id.
* **NOTE**: I am not sure why it returned the Scope as a relation.

# Conclusion

I hope you found this useful as a gentle introduction to the VersionOne Data API using JSON! But, might
you be itching to start coding against the API yourself, using familiar open source JS libs like 
jQuery and Backbone.js? If so, then stay tuned for the next how-to example, which will show exactly that!
